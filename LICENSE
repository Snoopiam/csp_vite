## Author's Note

Hey! I'm Snoop... not a professional coder, but learning to be a vibecoder.

When I encountered the infamous Content Security Policy (CSP) warning, it was
annoying as hell. So I vibe-coded and found a solution for personal use.
It worked for me, so I'm sharing it with anyone who gets stuck like I did.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** I do not take responsibility for anything. Use at your own risk.
